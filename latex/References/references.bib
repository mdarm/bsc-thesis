  abstract   = {Streamwise development of the axial velocity field in a confined, decaying swirling flow is explored in the present study. A tangential injection mechanism produces swirling flow at the inlet of a constant diameter pipe. Particle image velocimetry is employed for axial velocity measurements. Representative axial velocity profiles are presented for axial locations of 3 to 67 pipe diameters. The axial velocity profiles are asymmetric relative to the pipe centerline and the asymmetries persist as the flow develops in the axial direction. The eccentricity of the swirling flow spatially oscillates as the flow develops in the axial direction. The spatial oscillations of the axial velocity suggest that a vortex breakdown may be located near the inlet of the pipe and the entire pipe is the wake region of the vortex breakdown. The centerline axial velocity is also used to document the axial development of the flow. A comprehensive view of the flow field is provided by considering theoretical explanations presented in the literature for decaying, swirling pipe flows and for vortex breakdown.},

Complete Navier-Stokes equations have been solved by a finite element method using the FIDAP package. We have shown that a correct numerical modeling is strongly linked to the mesh generation, the design of which is crucial. Indeed, the tangential inlet induces recirculating flows, whose shapes and sizes are intimately depending on both the axial location from the swirl generator and the azimuthal position with respect to the tangential inlet axis. The swirl decay along the flow path has been characterized using various profiles of both tangential and axial velocity components, streamlines angles and local swirl intensity near both cylinders of the annulus. The mean swirl intensity in the whole annular gap thickness has been found to decrease exponentially from the entrance section.},

  abstract     = {Axial flow in an annulus between two concentric cylinders is commonly seen in various flow devices used in chemical processing industries and petroleum science and engineering. The flow state in the annulus strongly influences the performance of fluid transportation in the devices. Therefore, the determination of flow state which is laminar flow or turbulent flow is an important task to predict the performance of the flow devices. In previous works, we have proposed an energy gradient method for studying the flow instability and turbulent transition. In this method, it is shown that the flow instability and turbulent transition in wall bounded shear flows depend on the relative magnitude of the gradient of the total mechanical energy in transverse direction and the rate of loss of the total mechanical energy along the streamwise direction for a given imposed disturbance. For pipe and plane Poiseuille flows, it has been demonstrated that the transition to turbulence for these wall bounded parallel flows occurs at a consistent value of the energy gradient parameter (Kmax). In present study, the critical condition for turbulent transition in annulus flow is calculated with the energy gradient method for various radius ratios. The critical flow rate and critical Reynolds number are given for various radius ratios. Then, the analytical results are compared with the experiments in the literature. Finally, the implication of the result is discussed in terms of the drag reduction and mixing as well as heat transfer in practical industrial applications of various fluid delivery devices.},

The swirling motion of the air was produced by a single tangential slot, initially at 90 deg to the pipe axis, through which the air was introduced. The dimensions of the slot and the angle of tangency were varied and the resultant flow field inside the pipe was measured and expressed in the form of local “swirl numbers”. The augmentation of heat transfer was found to be a function of the swirl number and a correlation for this function is presented. At some locations, the augmentation can be as much as eight times the value for fully developed nonswirling turbulent flow.},

  abstract     = {An investigation is made into the reliability with which pressure loss, film thickness and liquid entrainment can be predicted by an annular flow model that is based on the well-known two-fluid (separated flow) concept. For this purpose a two-fluid model is presented which accounts for the interrelation between these variables. In this connection the existence of multiple liquid hold-up solutions is mentioned. New correlations for interfacial friction and liquid fraction entrained are proposed using data compiled previously at AERE Harwell. Our new model is compared with previous models. Differences between predictions are illustrated by reference to the Harwell data bank, recent large-diameter tests and hypothetical gas-well cases relevant to the oil industry. Application of the annular flow models, in particular their entrainment correlations, appears to give rise to widely varying results, restricting the predictive value of the models when extrapolated to large-diameter and/or high pressure systems.},
