\noindent The purpose of this thesis is to draw attention to the potential usefulness of swirling decaying flows in heat transfer enhancement. Swirling motion of air was produced by means of tangential inlet slots, through which the air was introduced. The number of slots and the angle of tangency were varied while the resultant flow field inside the annulus was kept below 2000 Reynolds. Careful consideration was given in keeping track of errors from both their collection of sources and through their propagation in the final results. On the matter of heat transfer enhancement, swirling flow showed real promise (augmentation upto \qty{24}{\percent} could be achieved), while on the matter of power consumption, swirling flow was considerably more demanding than the fully developed nonswirling laminar flow. Notwithstanding the acceptable accuracy of the experimental measurements, the data reduction yielded unusually large errors - upto \qty{300}{\percent} of the calculated value - thereby undermining the results', and the assumptions' made herein, credibility.
